        Our next example of dynamic programming is an algorithm that solves the problem
of matrix-chain multiplication. We are given a sequence (chain) hA1, A2, . . . , An i
of n matrices to be multiplied, and we wish to compute the product
A1 A2 · · · An . (15.10)\n\n
We can evaluate the expression (15.10) using the standard algorithm for multiplying
pairs of matrices as a subroutine once we have parenthesized it to resolve all
ambiguities in how the matrices are multiplied together. A product of matrices
is fully parenthesized if it is either a single matrix or the product of two fully
parenthesized matrix products, surrounded by parentheses. Matrix multiplication
is associative, and so all parenthesizations yield the same product. For example,
if the chain of matrices is hA1, A2, A3, A4i, the product A1 A2 A3 A4 can be fully
parenthesized in five distinct ways:\n\n
        The way we parenthesize a chain of matrices can have a dramatic impact on the
cost of evaluating the product. Consider first the cost of multiplying two matrices.
The standard algorithm is given by the following pseudocode. The attributes rows
and columns are the numbers of rows and columns in a matrix.
